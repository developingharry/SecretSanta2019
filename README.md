## Installation

Download and extract the zip, and open index.htm.

## Usage

Enter a budget, or max spend, for your secret santa event.  (eg. Â£5, "roughly a tenner", $4.50).

Type in the names of every participant.  You can use Enter to add a new blank entry, or press the "+" button.

Click the X to delete individual participants.

Press finished.

You will initially be presented with a button for each participant.  These contain a secret link for the participant to visit and find out who they were assigned.

You can now:

- Click individual participants to copy their link to clipboard.
- Click to copy all participants in one, for pasting into a group email, for example.
- Click to see who got who (and, if you wish, copy all THOSE results).
- Go back to make adjustments.
- Start from scratch.
